 * @details
 * Do \b NOT use this package to hold hundleds of classes/methods. That's a class design failure.
 * This package should contain really only a few methods and classes, each of which should be
 * extremely simple and unrelated each other. Otherwise, make a package for them.
 * Learn from the stupid history of java.util.
